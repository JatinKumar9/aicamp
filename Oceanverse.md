1.Ram and Lakshman were two brothers, Ram's pocket money was twice as much as Lakshman. The good boy that Ram and Lakshman were, they did not spend their pocket money on anything. They instead saved the same in their piggy bank. Every week, they would check their savings so far. Assume the first week's savings was $$(R_1,L_1)$$ and second week's $$(R_2,L_2)$$ and so on. They try plotting their weekly savings on a graph sheet. How will the points look like?

2.Atul's house is centered at origin $$(0,0)$$ he walks straight (along the x-axis) for 2 units and then takes a left and walks 1 unit to reach Bala's house, after that he takes a right turn and walks for one unit and then a left turn and walks for one unit and reaches Chetan's house. He continues in a similar style, takes a right turn 1 unit and then left turn one unit and reaches Divya's house. Are the houses of Bala, Chetan and Divya on a straight line?

17.$$A$$ is assigned $$0$$, $$B:1$$, $$C:2$$, and so on up to $$Z:25$$<br>
Assume you denoted every letter with a number, as given in the table above.<br> You need to encrypt the word $$SUDARSHANA$$ which stands for the numbers: $$18, 20, 3, 0, 17, 18, 7, 0, 13,0$$. <br>
You encrypt this using a matrix given by : $$ \left( \begin{matrix} 2 & 3 \\3 & 4 \\\end{matrix}\right) $$. <br>
So $$SUDARSHANA$$ will end up becoming: $$96, 134, 6, 9, 88, 123, 14, 21, 26, 39$$. <br>
Given these numbers, how will you decrypt the message and get back $$SUDARSHANA$$?<br>. This is a well known cryptographic protocol called the Hill Cipher. You can read more online.

18.We encounter equations very often in our lives. Consider for example, the following situation at ___Baker's Cafe___. The manager has a very important estimate to make. Mostly, visitors at his cafe happen to be families and they are often comprised of Children and/or Adults. He observes that there are 3 adults and 1 child at a table and their bill turns out to be Rs.1200/-. There is yet another table with 2 children and 1 adult and their bill comes out to be Rs.1000/-. Can the manager estimate the consumption of a Child/Adult? This is popularly called the _Simultaneous Equations_ and we all remember from our school days, multiple ways in which these can be solved.<br>
   $$ 3A + 1C = 1200 $$   
   $$ 1A + 2C = 1000 $$

19.While we were taught the so called two variables and two unknowns, what if there were more equations than unknowns?<br>
   $$ 3A + 1C = 1200 $$   
   $$ 1A + 2C = 1000 $$    
   $$ 1A + 1C =  900 $$

20.Note that the previous question can be modelled as a matrix:

   $$ 3A + 1C = 1200 $$   
   $$ 1A + 2C = 1000 $$    
   $$ 1A + 1C =  900 $$

   <u>Observe</u> this is same as :

   $$ \left( \begin{matrix} 3 & 1 \\1 & 2 \\1 & 1 \\\end{matrix}\right) $$
   $$\left(
   \begin{matrix}
   A\\
   C\\

69.Plot and find the distance between points using Geogebra: \(A(1,2)\), \(B(2,3)\), and \(C(5,9)\).

70.Using Geogebra, which two points are the closest ones? What's the distance between them?

71.Add four more points: \(D(0,-1)\), \(E(4,11)\), \(F(8,12)\), \(G(-3,6)\) to your graph. What’s the closest pair now? How many computations do you have to do?

72.Suppose we have 10 points. How many pairs of points do you have to consider for finding the closest pair?

73.What is the Y sorted order (by default assume ascending) of points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), \(E\)?

74.Plot a line \(L\) parallel to the Y-axis passing through the middle point in the X sorted order of the above points. Divide the set of points into left and right regions around the line.

75.Find the closest pair of points in the left region and right region. What’s the minimum distance (say \(d\)) between them?

76.Consider a band of width \(2d\) around the Line \(L\). Find the closest pair in this band. Compare this distance with \(d\), the minimum value of the corresponding closest pair of our graph. Is the answer the same as the brute-force method you applied in question 71? (This divide and conquer method is known as the closest pair algorithm).  

77.Astronomers have recorded the positions of stars in a 3D coordinate system where each star is represented as a point. Given the coordinates of stars \((1,2,3)\), \((4,5,6)\), \((6,7,8)\), \((10,11,12)\), find the closest pair of stars. (Use Geogebra)

78.If \(F(0) = 0\), \(F(1) = 1\), \(F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\) for \(n \geq 2\), find the value of \(F(5)\).

79.Dry run and find the output of the following python code:  
```
def f(n):  
	if n == 0:  
 		return 1  
   	return n * f(n-1)  
    print(f(5))
```  

80.Does the closest pair algorithm assume that the \(x\) coordinates (and \(y\) coordinates) of the points are distinct? Is there a problem with the \(O(n \log n)\) performance if they are not distinct?

81.Given a set of points where most points are far apart, but a few points are very close to each other, develop an algorithm to efficiently find the closest pair. For example, use the set: \((100,200)\), \((300,400)\), \((5000,6000)\), \((1,2)\), \((1.001,2.001)\).

82.Do you know the idea of equally likely events? What are these? Can you think of any event which is not equally likely?  

83.You are given two coins .What is the probability that one head and one tail shows up on tossing?  

84.In a class in which all students practise at least one sport, 60% of students play soccer or basketball and 10% practice both sports. If there is also 60% that do not play soccer, calculate the probability that a student chosen at random from the class:
 1 Plays soccer only.
 2. Play basketball only.
 3 Plays only one of the sports.
 4 Plays neither soccer nor basketball.
 
85.Imagine you are writing your semester exams . To write an exam , there are 70% chances that an alarm clock will wake you up successfully. If you hear the alarm clock then there are 95% chances you will write the exam and if you don't hear the alarm the chances are 50%.
a)If you have written the exam what are the chances that you heard the alarm clock?
b) What are the chances that you didn’t hear the alarm if you have not written the exam?

86.Lets say an investment company “Future Wealth“ analyses stocks and predicts whether their price will go up or down. So far, half of the stocks analysed by the company have gone up, 3/4 of the stocks that went up were correctly predicted to go up, and 2/5 of the stocks that went down were incorrectly predicted to go up. Suppose that the company tells you that it will go up. Compute the probability that the stock will indeed go up.
 
87.Imagine you are a bettor. You are watching a race between two horses A and B. Let’s say five races are conducted. Construct any three hypotheses defining winning probabilities of A and B. What confidence do you have in each of your hypotheses to be true? Lets say , out of 5 races A wins 3 and B wins the remaining 2. Then after 5 races , in which of your hypotheses will you have maximum confidence. As per your new hypothesis which horse has more chances to win the 6th round .

88.You're training a spam filter . You have data on the frequency of certain words in both spam and non-spam emails. How would you update your beliefs about an email being spam or not spam based on the presence of specific words?Let’s say initially chances of an email being spam is 40%.
Data: Word "free" appears in 80% of spam emails and 5% of non-spam emails

89.Suppose that we use a perceptron to detect spam messages. Let's say that each email message is represented by the frequency of occurrence of keywords, and the output is +1 if the message is considered spam.  
a) Can you think of some keywords that will end up with a large number of positive weight in the perceptron?  
b)How about keywords that will get a negative weight?  
c)What parameters in the perceptron directly affects how many border-line messages end up being classified as spam? 
  
90.Lets have some parameters 3.1, 4.2 and 4 and the corresponding weights 5,1,and 3 respt. Calculate the weighted sum. 

91.Suppose you have set of numbers ranging from -infinity to infinity. Will it be easy to plot them in a limited screen size and compare them?  

92.Will simply dividing them by some large number work?  

93.Can you think of a way to fit these numbers in some finite range? Think about some kind of functions?
